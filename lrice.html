               <p>Banaue Rice Terraces is a beautiful creation of Ifugaos which became one of the tourist spots in Luzon. With a careful manipulation of mud and stones, they have made giant steps carved in the mountains where they artistically plant rice. Considered as the 8th Wonder of the World, this magnificent work of art in ancient engineering and tools can be found in <strong>Ifugao, Luzon, Philippines</strong></p>
               <p>Banaue Rice Terraces is a magnificent work of ancient engineering and tools. It’s like a stepping stone from afar. A place of sustainable living agriculture applied with traditional techniques. Considered as the 8th Wonder of the world, it’s an awesome work and design of the indigents in Ifugao.  It’s over 2000 years old an elevation of 1500 meters above sea level.</p>
            <h4>Description:</h4>
               <P>Banaue Rice Terraces is formed through great precision and care. It was made out of stones, mud walls and sustainable irrigation system. The water source is located at the top of the terraces, pretty clever design. Rainforest provides waters to flow and the Ifugao funnel it to be distributed throughout the entire terraces. It is a ring of wood, they call it “mugong” and from it small pipes and channels distributes the waters to flow precisely to a complex design. It is a perfect cultivation for rice and agricultural products. Who could have thought from those primitive years they could design such an art with those difficult terrain.</P>
            <h4>How get to Banaue Rice Terraces:</h4>
                <p>The place is around 200 kilometers from Manila. Regular buses are traveling there so transportation is good. To enjoy more of the place, hiking around the terraces is the most suggested way to explore it not some tricycle rides. Of course what I mean is not from Manila to Ifugao, that’s pretty harsh. I mean when you reach the actual place. There are good terrains and travel guides so feel safe.  Along the way there are beautiful hidden falls and more views.</p>
                <p>You can actually reach those indigents and talk to their Mumbak. Do you know what a Mumbak is? That’s a witch doctor. A witch doctor that can heal and some spirit stuffs. They are approachable though just don’t show some offensive looks or actions.</p>
                <p>There also exist some picnic spots where you can view the beauty of Banaue Rice Terraces. If you want to rest there are some Inns that can be found near the area.</p>
                <p>Today, almost 20% of the terraces are deteriorating because of the rise of the modern age and technology. Some workers or villagers left the place to venture more life that’s why little by little is fading away. As of today, this magnificent art is still one of the famous tourist spots in the Philippines!</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
                <p>Always stay with the group, hiking maybe tiresome but if you are with the group, you have no choice but to catch up and just enjoy.</p>
            <h4>Trivia:</h4>
                <p>Did you know that “Hagdan-hagdang Palayan ng Banaue” is the most uttered word by Filipinos instead of Banaue Rice Terraces? It is simply because “Hagdan-hagdang Palayan ng Banaue” is the Tagalog translation of it.</p>
                <p>Banaue Rice Terraces made more popular because of the TV series entitled “Forevermore” of ABS-CBN shoots their scenes in the place. It actually boosts the tourism in Benguet.</p>
