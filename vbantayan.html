               <p>Bantayan Island is famous tourist destination in Visayas for its powdery white sand beach. 
                   Walking barefoot into the shallow waters or in the shore, you can feel the soft sand underneath. 
                   This beautiful beach is located in Cebu, Visayas, Philippines.</strong></p>
                <p>Bantayan Island boasts its powdery soft white sand beaches. The Island is located in Cebu which is 
                divided into three municipalities namely Bantayan, Madredejos and Santa Fe. There are actually smaller 
                    islands near Bantayan Island and near them is a lane for ferries from Cebu to Manila. The nearby 
                    islands are inhabitable though.</p>       
                <p>Bantayan Island is famous for its soft white sand. When you walk barefoot to the sand of Bantayan Beach, 
                    you can actually feel the relaxing sand. Even if you walk into the shallow waters of the beach, its 
                    actually even softer. If you try to put handful sand, it’s like holding a baby powder. Okay I may be 
                    exaggerating a bit about that baby powder thing but you can put it that way.</p>
                <p>Not just the white and soft powdery sand but you can actually appreciate the clear blue waters. 
                    If you want to swim and put your goggles on, you can actually appreciate the clear waters. Bantayan 
                    Island is unspoiled and clean.</p>
                <h4>How to get to Bantayan Island:</h4>
                <p>From Manila, you can catch up a flight going to Cebu. So let’s assume you are in Cebu. From Cebu Mactan 
                    Airport (where you landed) you will take a taxi that will take you to Cebu Bus Terminal 2. From the Cebu 
                    Bus Terminal 2 take a bus ride going to Hagnaya Port. From the port, you will have to take a ferry to 
                    Bantayan Island, Santa Fe.</p>
                <p>Please be reminded that the ferries travel schedule starts at 6:00 in the morning up to 5:00 in the afternoon.
                    A ferry will leave every 1 and 30 minutes. The travel time to Bantayan Island may take 1 hour.</p>
